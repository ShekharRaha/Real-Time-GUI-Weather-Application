# Real-Time-GUI-Weather-Application

Description:-
This project makes use of the Python programming language to design a real-  time GUI based interactive Weather Application. This project is aimed to   provide weather data for a large number of cities and towns, including some   minor cities which are not available in other weather apps. The project uses SQLite3 as the back-end to store the fetched data for further analysis.

Usage:-
1) Right-click on main.py
2) Click on Edit with IDLE
3) Click on 'Run' --> 'Run Module' or press F5
4) Enter the name of the city/town whose weather is to be checked
5) Go to Python Shell and enter the name of the country where the entered city is located
6) To add the resulting data to the database system, click on ADD TO DB
7) The database table will be displayed on the Python Shell
