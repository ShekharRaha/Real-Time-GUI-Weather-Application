# Real-Time-GUI-Weather-Application
This project makes use of the Python programming language to design a real-  time GUI based interactive Weather Application. This project is aimed to   provide weather data for a large number of cities and towns, including some   minor cities which are not available in other weather apps. The project uses SQLite3 as the back-end to store the fetched data for further analysis.
